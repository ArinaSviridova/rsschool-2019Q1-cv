3. My goal is to start my career as a Front-end developer at EPAM and grow to the team leader in three years.
Why do I need it? For me, website development is a huge platform for creativity, I enjoy this work, the possibilities of the front-end are endless.
This is what I like the most in Front-end.
I want to achieve as much as possible in this area. Therefore, I absorb new knowledge with great pleasure;
4. HTML, CSS, JS, GIT, WebStorm, Visual Studio, Local provisioning, Android Development;
5. I can't find code examples. Since my previous PC is RIP :(
6. Real work experience: more than 40 projects on freelance (mainly based on ready-made templates), examination work on completing courses in IT-Academy;
7. BSUIR (BA degree expected in 2021), Front-end fundamentals HTML, CSS, JS (IT-academy);
8. Pre-intermediate, additional English lessons during school, The university scientific work in computer science using English, friends and relatives from USA and UK (native speakers).

I need an additional commit so I decided to add this line :)
